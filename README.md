# To-do List
This is a simple to-do list application implemented using Raw Java 8.0

## Initialization

```bash
java -jar to_do_list.jar
```

## Usage

The application is as simple as it gets. There are tasks, each one with: a name, a description, a tag, an end-date, a status and a priority. You have access to CRUD commands and different ways to sort the tasks.

The CLI interface is very simple. It will ask for commands and show some options, then the user can write the command they want to execute, and the interface will guide them to finish the operation.
