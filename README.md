# To-do List
This is a simple to-do list application implemented using Raw Java 8.0 and Javascript

## Initialization

### Java version:
```bash
java -jar to_do_list.jar
```

### Javascript version:

Just host index.html

## Usage

The application is as simple as it gets. There are tasks, each one with: a name, a description, a tag, an end-date, a status and a priority. You have access to CRUD commands and different ways to sort the tasks.

The Java version uses a very simple text-based CLI interface. It will ask for commands and show some options, then the user can write the command they want to execute, and the interface will guide them to finish the operation.

The Javascript version offers all the CRUD operations in a more interactive manner, but with no connection to the Java backend. The tasks are stored in the user browser's local storage.
